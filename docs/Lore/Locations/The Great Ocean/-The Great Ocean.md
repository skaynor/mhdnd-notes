The Great Sea makes up the deep waters between the continents of the old world and the new world, with [[Moga Village]] and [[Deserted Island]] at its center. The ocean is ripe with fish and other terrifying monsters. It is so vast and cold you will most likely be eaten before you can swim any significant distance. In order to cross it, the Hunter's Guild primarily uses boats to cross the sea, but the Wycademy prefers airships. The sea god Persana is said to dwell in its depths.
