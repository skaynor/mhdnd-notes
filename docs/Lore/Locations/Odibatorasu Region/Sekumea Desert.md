The Sekumea Desert, also known as [[Sekumea Desert|The Great Desert]], is a sandy expanse that runs from [[The Dede Desert]] to the southern shore. The desert's name means 'Fall of Moondust' and is primarily ruled by Piscine Wyverns. It is well-known for its large ruins hidden beneath the sands and its extreme temperature changes. At day the intense heat can easily kill a human, while at night the freezing cold can easily cause hypothermia. The temperatures and the monsters make this area a living hell for most. Recently, hunters have discovered a giant, underground lake in the northern part of this desert. This lake is known to be inhabited by Plesioth.

### Hunting Grounds:
The Great Desert is a vast desert with sand as far as the eye can see. It spans across the Sekumea desert from [[Val Habar]] to [[Loc Lac City]]. It is home to the great Elder Dragon, Jhen Mohran and its subspecies, Hallowed Jhen Mohran. Dah'ren Mohran is also fought here. Delax and Remobra are the only small monsters that typically appear here.
