The Dede desert, better known as the Old Desert, or Dunes, was once a sea in ancient times. It is now a desolate desert ruled by many different species of monsters, like Cephalos and Monoblos, with only a few oases around the widespread sea of sand. These oases are known to attract thirsty creatures. Though the environment is harsh, this area is perfect for gathering some unique plants.
