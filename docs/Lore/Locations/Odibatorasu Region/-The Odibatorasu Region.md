Said to have been created by the Sand God, Odibatorasu, during the time of the ancient civilization. A once vast inhospitable barren waste land on the western side of the Old World was claimed by the monster as its own territory. The Odibatorasu burrowed through the ground grinding the bones, earth, and fossilized plants into a fine sand, terraforming the land into the deserts found today. It is unknown what stopped the Sand God from expanding its territory beyond the edge of [[The Old Jungle]], some believe the ancient civilization killed it during the Great Dragon War, while others believe it to be hibernating deep below the desert, perhaps it feared the black dragon of the [[-Schrade Kingdom|Schrade Kingdom]], or maybe its purpose the gods gave it was fulfilled.
