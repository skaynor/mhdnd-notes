The Desert hunting ground is split between both the [[Sekumea Desert]] and [[The Dede Desert]]. It is characterized by vast, sandy expanses, subterranean caves, and rocky, canyon-like areas. It is located in the northern half of the [[Sekumea Desert]] and is inhabited by many uniquely adapted monsters, such as Daimyo Hermitaur, Diablos, and Cephadrome.
