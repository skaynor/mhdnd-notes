Loc Lac City is a bustling trade city located on the borders of [[Sekumea Desert|The Great Desert]], and is a renowned hotspot among hunters. Legend has it that the giant spire-like sculpture at the center of the city is a carved tusk from the Elder Dragon Jhen Mohran, which often approaches the city and threatens its citizens.

The main street is home to a number of services and vendors. The Trading Post and Pint-Sized Peddler can be found to the left, as can the entrance to the Lodge Street. Straight ahead lies the Combinator and Captain Tool, as well as the entrance to the tavern. To the right is the entrance to the armory, and the Interior Diviner, who sells sculptures and other crafts that a hunter can place in their home. Lodge around where ti comes to a dead end at the other tavern entrance. 

The Tavern is the central gathering hall of the city, where hunters can initiate and join on hunts. There is a provision supplier, and meals can be eaten at any of the numerous benches. The entrance to the armory can be found to the far right.
