Unlike the other volcanoes in the El De Region, this hunting ground is located on an island to the west of [[Jumbo Village]] in the south el de region. This volcano has remained simply "The Volcano" without any prefixes or name changes. 

This hunting ground is a volatile location; it begins with low, forested areas, before moving to the base of the volcano, where lava collides with water, creating a curtain of steam at the shoreline. In addition, this volcano differentiates itself in that it has no dry, craggy, rocky areas, and the actual volcano is visible from camp, as opposed to ominous dark clouds in the distance. From the sea shore, the center volcano can be found, and finally the towering peak.
