The Terosu Jungle is a thick green, dense, tropical forest that is full of life: Neopteron, Theropods, Flying Wyverns, Piscine Wyverns, and even Elder Dragons call this place home. The jungle is a dangerous place even for hunters and the animals that live there, but there are plenty of mushroom and plant resources, which can prove key to survival when trying to defeat an enemy amidst the heavy foliage. The caves in the jungle have been known to be the home and nesting grounds of numerous creatures, including gypceros and queen vespoids.
