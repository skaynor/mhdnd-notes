## Guide Info
*Village - Population: 625
(80% Human, 8% Gnome, 8% Halfling, 4% Wyverian)*

Jumbo Village is a port village located near [[The Jungle]]. Instead of a guildhall, there's a tavern where hunters can partake in quests and challenge other hunters, or the reigning champion, the shipyard manager, to arm wrestling; or perhaps you would rather challenge the Wyverian Lady at the bar to a drinking game.

Unique to this village is its traveling merchants. Rarely does a merchant arrive that isn't a felyne. It also has the only known combination shop, where for a modest fee, the shopkeeper will craft requested items for a hunter. There are many other areas and shops in the village ranging from: a fish market, cantina, smithy, and shipyard.
