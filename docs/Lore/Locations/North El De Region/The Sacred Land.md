The Sacred Land is a remote area somewhere within the volcanic region. Due to the extreme heat, a Cold Drink is required for any hunter venturing into this land. Much like the battlegrounds, this area has been the lair for an Alatreon in the past. Within the sacred lands is a circular patch of land that is enclosed by a lava river, and contains two pools of lava in its center. The base camp is set up behind a crevasse in the mountain wall where hunters and scouts can rest. However, it is no easy task to climb the obsidian walls to the camp.
