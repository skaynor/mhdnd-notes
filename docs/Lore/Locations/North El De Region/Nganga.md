South of the volcano is a mining village called Nganga where hunters go to rest after long hunts in the region. It is popular amongst miners, due to the rare ores found in the region. It is also considered quite dangerous due to the many harsh species that live in this volcanic area. This means that hunters have never-ending jobs to both mine ore and hunt.
