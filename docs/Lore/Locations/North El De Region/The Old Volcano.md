The Old Volcano was the first hunting ground designated by the Hunter's Guild in the North El De Region. The area is an active volcano and the surrounding area. A camp has been set up at the base of the mountain, where the hunters can explore the surrounding area before making the journey to the molten center. On their journey they will travel through many caves, emerging from them before they can begin their perilous ascent to the peak. Withering heat demands that hunters use cool drinks if they wish to venture into this land. Hunters should also be wary of strange rocks which can explode violently when damaged.

Due to the little vegetation to be found, the Old Volcano is home to only the heartiest of creatures, including the Basarios, Gravios, Azure Rathalos, Yian Kut-Ku, Iodrome and Shogun Ceanataur. The low vegetation also means poor gathering in the ways of herbs and insects. These two shortcomings are far overcome by an overwhelming abundance of ores and minerals to be mined.
