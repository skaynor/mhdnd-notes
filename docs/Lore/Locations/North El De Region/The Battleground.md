Aptly named the 'battleground', this hunting ground is located in the back-end of the Volcanic Belt. Getting to the battleground is no easy task due to the mile wide lava rivers that flow around the area, but it is nothing compared to the beasts that call it home. Ferocious beasts such as the Fatalis and Akantor make their lair in this large barren space. Due to this, the guild has never been able to set up a base camp in this area, and it is impossible to leave the area without use of magic or an airship like the Soaratorium.
