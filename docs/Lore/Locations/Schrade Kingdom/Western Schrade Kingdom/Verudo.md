Known as the "Fortified Fortress", Verudo is the largest city in Western Schrade. Surrounding Verudo is a giant wall with cannons facing all directions to protect the city from incoming attacks. Though the inner city is well protected the outer city isn't. Forced out of its protective walls, the city's poor and disenfranchised citizens nicknamed "wall-crawlers" attempt to survive and find a way back into the city.
