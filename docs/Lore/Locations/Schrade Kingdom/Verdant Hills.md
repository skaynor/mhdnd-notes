Found in the Arcolis Region, the Verdant Hills, also known as the Forest and Hills, consists of deep forests, high hills, and vast grasslands, possessing an overall temperate climate. The herbivores Aptonoth and Kelbi roam the hills, as the location has an abundance of foliage, along with packs of Velociprey. While this zone may seem perfect for novice hunters, it is not entirely danger-free; Rathalos and Rathian are commonly seen nesting on the highest cliffs, whilst Yian Kut-Ku, Yian Garuga, and even the Elder Dragons are known to inhabit this location as well.
