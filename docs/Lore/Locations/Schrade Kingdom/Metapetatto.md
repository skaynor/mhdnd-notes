Metapetatto is a rural area south of [[Arcolis Region]], where hunter villages are known to be located. A Lao-Shan Lung is said to take route here, so hunters are known to wait here to protect any villages within the area from a potential attack from this giant. Within this area is the hunting ground known as the Old Jungle as well as the West Wyvern Sea. From the West Wyvern Sea hunters receive and send materials to other places.
