## Guide Info
*City - Population: 40,250
(83% Human, 6% Dwarven, 11% Other)

After the disappearance of the ancient civilization, the humanoid races sent out explorers to discover new locations to settle. During one of these trips, the explorer's discovered the ruins of a town along the coast in the grassy plains south of the wetlands. As they began to explore these ruins, the team came face to face with a sleeping lao-shan lung. In their panic, the exploration team woke up the lao-shan lung. The Lao rampaged across the city, crushing buildings into dust while it chased down the explorer's. Just as the explorers gave into despair, what can only be described as a miracle occurred. A gargantuan wyverian in samurai style armor charged into battle against the lao-shan lung. The battle raged for hours, until the Lao fled in shame and the giant wyverian turned towards the explorers.

Months later, repairs began in the city. The gargantuan wyverian, known as [[His Immenseness]], worked with the humanoid races in rebuilding the city. With his help it took almost no time to repair the first districts. From his direction and leadership, the city of Dundorma was founded and the headquarters of the newly founded Hunter's Guild had a home.

For a long time after its founding, Dundorma was constantly attacked by all sorts of Elder Dragons. To defend the city against these threats, they made all sorts of powerful weapons to defend the city, which eventually led to them making the Original Dragonator to defend the city. The Original Dragonator alone defeated many foes and defended Dundorma time after time. From this success, it became the symbol of the city. Over time, however, the Dragonator got old and wasn't as useful as it once was so the city replaced it with a newer, more powerful one. The old Dragonator was put into a weapons warehouse by [[His Immenseness]] and was left there as a memory for Dundorma.

#### Government:
Ruled by [[His Immenseness]] who appeared at Dundorma from the very beginning and greatly helped in this town's development. He can be best described as a wise and adventurous old man. He is known for his almost cold yet blunt personality with a strong sign of leadership. He helped the town build the Battlequarters, formed the [[Elder Dragon Observation Team]], and established the Guardians to protect the town. 

#### Crime:
Crime in Dundorma is almost nonexistent. With the creation of the Guardians to police the town and the fact that any criminal that is caught is judged by [[His Immenseness]], the only criminals are the foolish.

#### Geography:
The city was originally rebuilt with help from [[His Immenseness]] not long after discovery of the ancient civilizations ruins repairs continued over a few generations. Castle Dundorma was in the middle of town and a large tower was built so that the [[Elder Dragon Observation Team]] could overlook the city and surrounding area from all sides. The east end of Dundorma is still being repaired to this day and the southern border has enough farmland to sustain the citizens of the town. To the north, the Wetlands encroaches on the exterior walls providing protection from creatures not suited to the swampy terrain. There is no cemetery in the town. By decree of [[His Immenseness]], the dead are instead honored and then burned. Burying the bodies would attract additional threats to the town

#### The Hunter District:
The Hunter District is the central district of Dundorma. This district houses the Hunter's Guild headquarters and the Elder Dragon Observation Center is located here. The district provides all the amenities a hunter could ask for, from access to some of the best Smithy's and supplies in the world, to luxurious homes where famous hunters stay.

The district also contains the collective knowledge of the researchers who seek out information on the ancient civilizations' secrets and the world's greatest enemies, the elder dragons.

#### The East and South Gate Districts:
There are two gate districts located in the each and south of Dundorma. The southern district is commonly used by folks traveling to and from the city. this might be to work in the farmlands to the south of the city, or perhaps because it is safer than the east gate. 

The east gate leads out to the ruins where the Elder Dragons attack. The Guardians barracks and hunters assigned to the defense of Dundorma call this district home.

The South Gate district is where people live whose profession is at the town gate. Not full merchants, as merchants have their own district, but cunning middlemen, clever brokers, shrewd money changers, stout day laborers, strong porters, and swift deliverymen, all live and make a living here. Not to mention the district has more than a few comfortable taverns, the gates guardians and their barracks, scholars, and beggars.

#### The Merchant District:
The Merchant District, located near the docks in the western side of Dundorma, serves as the prime location for trade and business transactions between vendors, or large-scale merchant families, and their customers. A large bazaar covers most of the northern section of the district where merchants of all sorts can be found.

#### Landmarks:
The Imperial Palace is located in the northern district of Dundorma . It was built shortly after repairs began on the city, and constructed over the location where the Lao-Shan Lung made its nest. It has been the home to [[His Immenseness]] and the [[Royal Paleontology Scriveners]] since its completion.
