Riveru, city of [[-Eastern Schrade Kingdom]], is the largest city in the kingdom. Located east of the Castle Schrade Ruins, it is surrounded by steep mountains, making its winters longer than most other places. From these long winters, special facilities have been made to keep the people warm during those harsh season. For protection, there is a huge cannon similar to Verudo, and an observatory used to monitor monsters around the city.

**Trade Specialists**
Riveru greatly specializes in trading, using sled monsters to transport their goods. These monster are their specialty. It makes traveling through the Hinmerun Mountains an easy, quick, safe trip. It trades with the towns that are within Eastern Schrade, including Dundorma, but they won't trade a single thing to Western Schrade.
