Hinmerun Mountains or the 'Mountains Near the Sky', are local mountains within the Schrade Region that divide Eastern Schrade and Western Schrade. These mountains are much longer than both Schrade Kingdom and [[Dundorma]], making them a troublesome obstacle for travelers. However, the travel is greatly shortened if one rides an airship. The west side of the mountains is warm while the east side is cold.
