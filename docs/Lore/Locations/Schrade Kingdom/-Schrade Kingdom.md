Encompassing the entire north western side of the largest continent in the Old World. The Schrade Kingdom remained one of the great powers in the world until a thousand years ago, when the Great Wyvern Disaster struck the center of the kingdom, bringing an end to the Great Dragon War. Years later, the kingdom reformed into two separate ones, known as the Eastern and Western Schrade Kingdoms. The kingdoms act independently from one another. They have even stopped communicating in recent years. Castle Schrade Ruins remain neutral ground for the kingdoms, neither wanting to disturb the monster believed to have caused the Great Wyvern Disaster.

### Hunting Life Magazine:
**The Lay of the Land - Special Edition**
I am the top geographer in [[Minegarde]]. This is the record of my life's research. This Special Edition of my work is information about Castle Schrade. Castle Schrade is an ancient castle located in the vast open plain in the center of Schrade. After the great wyvern disaster, what was once a splendid feudal manor, is now a mere shadow of its former glory, surrounded only by the ruins of the villages and towns that used to encircle it. So complete is the devastation, that no one remains to mourn its passing.

It is said that the Fatalis, the creature believed to have caused the disaster, still inhabits this region of the world and detests all life, even other monsters. Reports from the Hunter's Guild have sighted other creatures actively avoiding the ruins of Schrade.

However, more troubling are the sightings from traders who stray near the kingdom's border, only to see a dragoness silhouette on the horizon and a screech loud and terrifying. All of this before they flee for their lives. The Guild has dispatched hunting parties to Schrade, but few of them return and those that do come back scarred and changed.
