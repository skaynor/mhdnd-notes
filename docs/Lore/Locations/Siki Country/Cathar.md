*Small Village - Population: 336*

Cathar is a small village located high up above cloud level, near Heaven's Mount. A small Wyverian farming community resides here with a market store and armory available for visiting hunters. North of the village is a shrine decorated with many pinwheels where the Grand Guru can be found during urgent times.

Legends tell of the grand guru passing down a song to a great hunter who ventured to heaven's mount, to defeat a shagaru magala. This is that song:

#### Cathar's Song
If ever eyes of darkness widen
A light from yonder soon will break
But if the land the light should brighten
A shadow wanders in its wake
If dawn is sent to slay the night
And chase its minions underground

Then when dusk makes the day take
Night Beneath it pinions night rebounds
But do not cry, my sons and daughters
Life must leave to come again
And when it does, it springs like water

A great reprieve to and all pain
Turn now, Heaven's Wheel! Turn, turn, that we may heal!

If ever should the dead awaken
Then welcome them as life reborn
And in my heart from sleep is taken
Then let it sing upon the morn
Let all those souls be held entranced
And gather to my mighty strains
For if they die again, by chance,
Their voices join the grand refrain
Each soul shall have its time again
Within hearts they still reside
And when I sing, they are sustained
From death to life, I am their guide.

Rejoice, rejoice my friend!
Our song will never end!
Never, ever end!
