Bateyubatomu Great Forest, better known as the Great Forest, is a mostly unexplored region with many hidden mysteries within it. This giant forest has only recently been explored by hunters and researchers, most of it still unknown to them. What is known is that Shakalaka villages can be seen in darker parts of the area, different species of Nargacuga hide in the shadows, waiting to pounce, and even Elder Dragons have been seen in this area. In some high up treetops, known as the [[Great Forest Peak]], rare monsters can be seen living in the highest points of the Great Forest.

#### Hunting Ground - The Great Forest
This hunting ground is found on the southern border of the Great Forest near [[Heaven's Mount]]. It is a lush, tropical rainforest characterized by thick green vegetation, towering trees, clear freshwater lakes and rivers, and a single massive tree at its center.

#### Monster Lairs - Great Forest Peak
This lair is the top of the giant tree at the center of the Great Forest.
