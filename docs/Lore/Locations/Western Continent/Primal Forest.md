#### Hunting Grounds - The Primal Forest

The Primal Forest Hunting Ground is a tropical area, a lush swath where the rain is warm and the rivers are cool and refreshing. Cradled by waterfalls, this hunting ground is called home by many monsters who freely indulge in the luxury. Towards the fringes of the forest, hunters will approach more desolate territory where many larger monsters carve their nests and stake their claim to the land. Poison pools that naturally form and well up onto the ground and commonplace. If a hunter sees any pool of purple liquid, they best not step in it.
