  - The Western Continent
---
An almost entirely unexplored content to the west of the West Wyvern Sea. This continent is almost entirely covered by an ancient forest, and thereby exhibits unique ecological features compared to the rest of the Old World, including the great forest. It provides a diverse habitat for rarely seen variants and subspecies, such as the Nightcloak Malfestio or Ash Kecha Wacha. In the southeastern region of the continent is a large mountain with hot springs with unnatural healing properties. A village was constructed over these hot springs and two hunting grounds were designated nearby. Beyond the village and hunting grounds, the western continent is off limits to all hunter activity unless permission is expressly given by the Hunter's Guild HQ or his Immenseness.
