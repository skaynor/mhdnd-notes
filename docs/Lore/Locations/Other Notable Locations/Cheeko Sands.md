*Small Village - Population: 156
(90% Lynian, 10% Other)*

Cheeko Sands is an isolated island in the West Wyvern Sea, with a mild climate and rich vegetation all year round. This secluded paradise rarely gets any visitors, and is only inhabited by the Lynian, and an old Wyverian lady named "Cat Granny," who serves as the mayor of this small community.

Due to the strong current and tides around the island, many things are washed up on its beaches - even large galleons (one of which can be sene behind the local shops). The Felyne residents take advantage of this, and collect any useful debris to build and expand Cheek Sands.

### Sunsnug Isle
An isle near Cheeko Sands (which can be seen from the main island, near the marooned galleon), called Sunsnug Isle serves as a meeting hall for the felyne hunters who take quests to repel local monsters. A female felyne, dubbed as "The Manager," takes care of business here and looks after the felyne hunters. Sunsnug Isle offers various activities, including a training facility, a relaxing place for non-active palicoes (which can be seen playing behind the guild tents, or floating about in the sea), a casting Machine (A giant net launcher for catching fish and the occasional plesioth), and a Meownster Hunter quest post where palico's go to place their requests.
