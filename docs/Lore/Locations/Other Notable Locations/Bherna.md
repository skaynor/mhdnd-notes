Located in the grassy plains between the snowy mountains, Tensou Jungle, and Dundorma, Bherna is the center point of information and trade between many of the different regions. In Wyverian, it is said that Bherna means the 'Gateway to the Wycademy', though the source of this is unreliable. Still some researchers believe this to be true, due to the fact that the Wycademy was founded in Bherna and it has remained the headquarters since its founding.

Like all other villages, Bherna Village is home to a kitchen, the smithy, a market and armory, homes, and other necessities. Towards the center of the village the Chief Researcher of the Wycademy can be typically found talking to one hunter or another. Out of all the researchers working for the Wycademy, he has the most knowledge about monsters and is the one responsible for updating the information about all known monsters and passing that information along to the hunter's guild.

To the east of Bherna is the Palico Ranch. It is a small community of felyne and melynx who provide additional assistance to the hunters of Bherna.
