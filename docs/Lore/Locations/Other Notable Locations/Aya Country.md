Aya Country is an isolated, small continent within the southeast of the sea. This place is said to have many generations of kings with absolute power over the country, though very little is actually known about it. This is mainly due to the civilians of this country refusing to exchange anything with other places outside their own home. Even hunters haven't gotten any requests from the people of Aya Country.
