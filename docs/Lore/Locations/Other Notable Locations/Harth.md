Harth is an underground town near [[Harth#Everwood|Everwood]], where magma flows freely. It is home to a tribe of mole-like people known as Troverians, who make a living mining ore and performing smithy work. They also use the magma in the area to make special equipment, weapons, and armor. The town is ruled by the chief who sported a big curly beard (which is a symbol of authority in their culture). The chief also has a very energetic daughter who helps out with all the ironsmith work.

### Everwood
The Everwood is a forested area located on a large island northwest of the western continent. Characterized by the massive ruins and architectural elements seen amount the environment, this area appears to have been richly inhabited by human at some point in it history. Now, however, the structures are very ancient and crumbling, with thick overgrowth evident as nature continues to reclaim the area.
