Jio Telado Marsh, better known as the Old Swamp or Telado Marsh, is north of Dundorma. Most avoid the marsh due the poisonous muck around the environment. The poisons are in the land, the water, and even the air. Not to mention, the swampy environment can be quite muddy from all the humidity. Though Jio Telado Marsh is a harsh environment, hunters have been going to the area in order to gather the rare minerals found within it. These minerals are known to attract monsters like Basarios and Gravios.
