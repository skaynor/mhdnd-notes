This hunting ground is located along the northern coastline of the snowy mountains. It is an icy stretch of land characterized by a flowing river of fresh water, tall formations of ice,  coniferous trees, and dark, frozen caves. This snowy place is home to many types of uniquely-adapted monsters, such as Lagombi, Barioth, Gigginox, and Great Baggi. A Hot Drink is necessary in all areas except the base camp.
