The Frozen Sea is a frozen ocean surrounding an unexplored arctic landmass in the north most point of the world. It gained its name due to its frigid water and depending on the season, most of the sea is frozen over by pack ice and enormous glacial ice sheets. It has been speculated by researchers that if not for the steady current underwater, the sea would have frozen over long ago. The Frozen Sea is home to many different creatures that have adapted to its freezing temperatures. It is not uncommon to see a lagombi sleeping on a sheet of ice, or zamites following along with a ship, waiting for an unlucky seaman to fall overboard.
