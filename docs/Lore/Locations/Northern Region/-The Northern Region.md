  - The Northern Region
---
The northern region consists of subarctic cold territories like the snowy mountains that are dominated by coniferous forests, bountiful flora, fauna, terrifying monsters, and many kinds of terrain variations. Further north the climate changes, transitioning from a subarctic climate, to arctic. Permafrost regions begin to appear, like the frozen seaway or the polar fields. These are dominated by sea ice, glaciers, pack ice and open ocean. Only the hardiest creatures roam here, and very little foliage is found.
