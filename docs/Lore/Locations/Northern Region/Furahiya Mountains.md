Furahiya Mountains, better known as the Snowy Mountains or [[Furahiya Mountains|Arctic Ridge]], is a mountain range that extends out to the north. Furahiya Mountains are bitterly cold year round, even during the summer. The snow in these mountains is said to never melt. During the colder seasons, the mountains are constantly hit by snowstorm after snowstorm causing the mountains to become unstable causing avalanches that flow into the river at the base of the mountain. In legends, there are two gods that live in the Furahiya Mountains; the Black God and White God.

### The White God
> A mysterious wyvern said only to appear after large avalanches deep in the snowy mountains. Often seen crushing ice balls and rock into powder in its stride, it's known to the Guild as Ukanlos, although there are whispers in [[Pokke Village]] that it may be the white god.

### The Black God
> A wyvern truly wrapped in mystery. Known to some as the black god, the tyrant of fire, and in some villages its name means disaster. Some of the extremes that have been seen with the monster's presence include droughts and heavy thunderstorms. This large and brutal creature is known to the Guild simply as Akantor.
