## Session Expectations:
- Monster Hunter is all about hunting the monsters
- Aim for a minimum of 1 hunt per session
	- Limit to 1 if heavy story progression
	- 0 hunts in a session should be avoided (unless they're vibing with it)
- 2-3 Sessions between levels
	- Early on can be 2, should scale up with harder difficulty?
	- Depends on how long we have between sessions
		- If we can average 3 a month, I will make it one level per month on average

## XP Leveling:

![[Cumulative XP Chart.webp]]
- Cumulative Party XP will determine the level of everyone in the party
- Even absent character will maintain the same level as the rest of their party
- How to gain XP?
	- Killing monsters (XP per CR of the Monster)
	- Completing Guild Quests
		- HR 1-7, XP is given based on rank
			- 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21 (in 1000s)
		- HR 7 quests can become increasingly more difficult
			- 34, 55, 89 (in 1000s)
			- 89 reward quests should happen at most twice in the campaign
			- (Quests should fall off in how much XP you get)

## Feats:
- Weapon based feats are restricted visibly by level and secretly by consistent effective weapon usage during hunts
	- Weapon should be used to effectively 20 times to be eligible for weapon mastery
		- Damage dealt, song effect activated, kinsect essence gathered, etc.
		- This requirement should be easy by level 10 unless someone is actively avoiding the use of their weapon (too much focus on spell casting)
- If a player has a feat they would like to obtain, they must justify how their character has earned that feat
	- During downtime they study, train, etc.
	- Active experimentation during hunts/battle to master the skill
