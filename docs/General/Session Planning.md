# Session 1
## The Start of the Journey:
- Starting Town: *[[Dundorma]]*
- It is one day after the Spring Blossom Festival, where graduates from the Hunter Academies become fully fledged hunters and get assigned their duties (whether or not they all technically graduated for those with different backgrounds)
	- They are meeting together in the [[Dundorma#The Hunter District|Hunter District]] to get assigned a [[Enno|handler]] to manage the party due to their large size
	- Meeting at a smaller Guild Hall, Dodogama Hall, run by a mid-tier guild manager [[Karrak]]
	- Having been sent to Karrak, this group is a "special" group that will take requests as they please and are free to be sent to any village
		- Most Hunters are stationed at one village for a large portion of their career, but having been suspicious of the group's abilities, they were assigned to Karrak, who had requested Enno be assigned to a hunting group.
- They are recommended a few hunts "of their skill level"

| Hunt Name | Main Monster | Difficulty |
| --------- | ------------ | ---------- |
| [[Two Page Monster Hunt - Wingdrake Roundup.pdf|Wingdrake Roundup]]| Wingdrakes | Easy |
| [[Two Page Monster Hunt - Tusked Tantrum.pdf|Tusked Tantrum]] | Tetsucabra | Medium/Hard |
| [[Two Page Monster Hunt - The Swirling Gale.pdf|The Swirling Gale]] | Great Izuchi | Medium/Hard |
| [[Monster Hunt - Dune the Honors.pdf|Dune the Honors]] | Barroth | Hard/Deadly | 
| [[Two Page Monster Hunt - Go Away, Pukei!.pdf|Go Away, Pukei!]] | Pukei-Pukei | Deadly | 

- The BBEG has been having an influence on monsters for a while but only recently is it coming to the attention of the Guild.
	- Monsters are appearing in areas they are not native too 
	- Reports of erratic behavior among monsters have become more common
	- Rumors of rampaging monsters found dead by hunters sent to deal with them, no sign of resistance by the monster or evidence of interference by a poacher or rogue hunter
		- There is magical evidence but few hunters are proficient enough with magic to recognize this

## Session Notes:
### Hunting Roles:
- (Gwen) Ilia: Scout
- (Matt) Adam: Trailblazer
- (Louis) Felonious: Artisan
- (Kale) Felix: Scout+
- (Ben) Trunk: Spotter+
- (Hailey) Lucerys: Spotter

### Chosen Hunt:
[[Two Page Monster Hunt - Tusked Tantrum.pdf|Tusked Tantrum]]
#### On the hunt:
- Felonious blows the artisan meal check out of the water
	- Mild Herbs
	- Rolls Felyne Provoker on the Daily Skills chart
		- Once per meal, you can roll a d4 and add the number rolled to one saving throw of your choice. You can roll the die before or after making the saving throw.

They completed the hunt without much struggle (only one downed, everyone else healthy)

### Review:
- Felonious got one shot without much counter-play
	- I had to do some weak targeting by the Tetsucabra to split damage and not kill everyone
	- EVERYONE IS AT DANGER OF LIMB LOSS
		- Maybe don't implement disabilities for the sake of the campaign?
		- I will put it up to party vote
- The party is vulnerable to CR 4 creatures
	- If Adam isn't grappling them they could just straight up die
- I should balance encounters around multiple weaker monsters
	- 1 CR 3 and a couple CR 1s 
	- Theropod battles work well for this formula
	- or Great Jagras? (need to check CR)

# Session 2
## New Lives, New Faces:
- Starting Town: *[[Dundorma]]*
- The party has returned from their first hunt and presumably spent the night at the guild hall
	- They are currently the only party assigned to Dodogama Hall, the first in the past couple years.
		- Since then, people have still used the hall as a place to stay, particularly for parties using Dundorma as a stopping point in a greater journey, but they haven't had anyone specifically assigned to them in years.
		- Dodogama Hall is still funded and recognized by the Guild due to the hard work Karrak and for fear that he might try to rebel against them should he be threatened by the Guild as a whole. 
	- Due to Karrak's estrangement from the greater Hunter's Guild, the hall has only ever been assign "undesirable" groups and misfits
		- The last party to be assigned to the Hall was sent off to the New World a couple years ago and have presumably been completing assignments there.
		- Why is Karrak estranged from the rest of the Guild?
			- Racial. Not many dwarves are present in the organization other than in the smithy, but he is a former guild knight
			- Incident in his former life as a Guild Knight, Guild negligence got his party killed
- At this point I expect the party to try and investigate the town and story a bit more
	- Need a fuller understanding of all major characters' backstories
	- Enno, Karrak, Kitel 
- Downtime activities will be explained, but not much the party can do at this point. (No money)
- Need to explain how gathering materials works on the hunt
	- Need to read more on it, but the party should start now if they want to improve their equipment at a decent pace
	- There is a whole system about gathering resources on a hunt that I completely missed
	- Essentially, during hunts and travel through areas you are allowed to look for resources up to the area's gather DC (with a limit on how often you can search for resources as well)
- I need to make a couple fresh hunts
	- Requirements:
		- 1 CR 3, 2 CR 1
		- 2-3 CR 2 (this might be a bit much)
		- Couple encounters based on other hunts
			- Make a good number of gathering options available
	- [[Two Page Monster Hunt - The Swirling Gale.pdf|Swirling Gale]] is looking like a good pick for the party
		- Need to make a few more Theropod quests like this
		- Wroggi and Baggi team up? or territory fighting?
	- ***UPDATE:*** GWEN WILL BE ABSENT
		- I should scale the encounter for 4 2nd Level PCs
		- Most of the damage in the last hunt came from Gwen so this will be easier for them
		- [[Two Page Monster Hunt - Wingdrake Roundup.pdf|Wingdrake Roundup]] should be relatively safe for them and I can use the easier nature of the hunt to help explain some of the gaps I was missing before about the gathering system during hunts.
		- I should also get better about tracking time during hunts, it seems a lot of hunt events are time based

# Session 3
## Something's Amiss:
- Starting Town: *[[Dundorma]]*
- Party returns from their second hunt and Ilia comes back from her absence.
- No urgent reports from the higher ups of the guild, but there are stirrings of some things happening across the continent
	- Karrak is absent for a meeting between all of the Guild Managers
	- Enno is "in charge" of the Hall until Karrak returns, but not much is expected to happen
		- The party needs to make a plan for the Steve, like are they just locking him in a room for a bit??
	- The next quest they take on will have an anomaly not listen in the original report
		- Monster will be enraged, have evidence of magic used on it, be undead
		- Monster being enraged is good for the short term (as there is game implementation for that)
			- Monsters have become enraged due to attempts at ancient elder dragon magic (should have a dark, Fatalis-like, elder dragon glow to the monster)
		- Monster having magic used on it could be indicated by it having an extra damage type (fire, cold, lightning) that is different from its normal attribute
		- Undead monsters should be saved for later as the party tries to understand more what the goal of the BBEG is
- Should the BBEG be near the party? Or are these older experiments coming forward. 
	- His Immenseness has probably always been aware of this threat, but has chosen to ignore it as he was not causing any issues near Dundorma
	- Now that the problem has spread closer to the city it becomes relevant to the higher ups of the Guild and they notice that other such reports further out have been carried out by the same person. 
	- This experiment is a week old, having been seen as a failure by BBEG, he left. But only now is it obvious that his work was a partial success, having influence the behavior of the monster using Elder Dragon magic.
	- The Guild can tell that the BBEG is enraging monsters, but the one the party encounters will be the first report of a monster being angered by ancient magic (Enno will be the one to notice this)
		- After a few more incidents (3-4) the party will be assigned to go travel in the direction of the incidents being reported 
		- #todo Figure out the direction the party and BBEG are moving in, figure out what I want their first "boss" encounter to be
- A couple days have passed, but no new assignments have come in yet due to the Guild meeting. Currently the party has one quest available to them, or they can wait for Karrak to come back presumably with more requests from the Guild.
	- If the party chooses to wait for Karrak they are urgently assigned a quest that Karrak is nervous to send the party on but he cannot deny the request due to its urgency
	- Enno will actively participate in the urgent quest

# Session 4
## A Looming Threat:
- Karrak and Enno have gone to the higher ups in the Guild to report on the anomaly witnessed in the previous session
- Felonious is away on summons (Louis won't be here), he will be asked as the Apprentice Guild Knight in the group to give his testimony of what he witnessed. He will not be given much info on the situation directly.
	- I will have to discuss with Louis if he tries to learn anything or if he just answers the questions as asked.
- The rest of the party is left with limited quests to go on as they wait for word from Karrak and Enno on assignments or other opportunities.
