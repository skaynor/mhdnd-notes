How is this different from 5e?
## Summary:
- Magical equipment is replaced with Monster Hunter weapons/armor
- Rarely will you find a better item to wield, rather you upgrade your equipment and augment it with monster parts
- Carve or capture monsters for resources
- New gods for each domain
- New races added and old races have updated origins
- Factions are heavily utilized (Renown rules: *The Guildmaster's Guide to Ravnica* pg.29)
- New Backgrounds
- New Features
- Hunting Roles for party expeditions

## Mechanics:
### *Carving*
- Make a Dexterity (Survival) check against the creature's Carve DC
	- `Carve DC = 10 + 1/2 of the creature's CR rounded down`
- On a success, roll a d20 and compare the result to the creature's loot table. On a failed save, treat the roll as if they rolled a 1 on the loot table.
- Variant Carve Rule: Rewarding the Natural 20
	- `When you roll a natural 20 on a Carve check, you roll an additional d20 and add this number to the loot table roll. The new number is the material found on that carve check.`
	- *`Any total higher than 20, counts as if a 20 was rolled.`*
### *Capturing*
- Loot table table is still rolled as in carving, but no check is made.
- Material is not gathered until you have returned back to a town.
### *Hunting Roles*
- Trailblazer
	- Primary Skill: Survival
- Spotter
	- Primary Skill: passive Perception
- Scout
	- Primary Skill: Perception, Stealth
- Artisan
	- Primary Skill: Cooking Utensils, Three highest Ability Scores
### *Cooking*
- I aint even gonna try and summarize this

## Factions:
More can be added or removed, but not everyone should be loyal to the Hunter's Guild
### *Hunter's Guild*
- The main governing body in most of the world
- Branches every but they all act independently and often don't share 100% of their information between each other
	- Membership is the only consistency
### *Wycademy*
- Research Institution
### *Elder Dragon Observation Team*
- A corporation led by His Immenseness
### *Royal Paleontology Scriveners*
- A research institution
### *Talon Society*
- A poachers ring
### *The Cult of Fatalis*
- pretty self explanatory
